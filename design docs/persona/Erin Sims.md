## About

Age: 11

Education: Middle School

Experience: 5 years of Lower School

Responsibilities: Get good grades. House chores. Tends the family pets and plants.

Initial touch-point: Her mom bought Erin a mobile phone when she started after school sports so that they could coordinate drop-off and pick-up times. It came with an XR app for identifying plants, animals, and insects.

## Highlights

- Uses her phone for everything, but occasionally will use her mother's laptop to write reports for school
- Enjoys being around people at all times. Likes to read, but prefers to do it with others in the room

## Goals

- Figure out how the world works
- Avoid boring and angry adults
- Fit into the increasingly complex social groups at school and running practice

## Frustrations

- When her mom get annoyed because she asks so many questions about insects and plants
- She's not allowed to spend any money on the phone for or in apps
- Her father lives two states away so she rarely sees him in person

## User story

Erin lives with her mother in the central district of Grenoble. Her block has lots of other kids so she's usually in a group of kids, either from school or from her street. All of the kids have phones or tablets that they use for messaging and for almost all of their homework.

You'd pick out Erin because she's forever stopping to look at plants and bugs by the sidewalk. Her friends squeel but Erin just watches them go about their lives and wonders what they eat and how they live. Erin runs with a group after school and the coach had to talk to her about stopping during practice.

Erin's father, when he calls, often tells her how important it is to get through high school. He didn't and regrets it, so Erin feels that it's important and it's pretty easy for her so it's no big deal. Her mom lets her have a lot of plants and animals, and she spends about an hour each day tending them. On weekends, her mother and she work their way through the chore list and then if there's a good kid's movie they'll bus downtown and watch it in one of the cinemas.
