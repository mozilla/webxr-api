Frank arrives home after a tough day at work, looking forward to a glass of wine and the latest episode of his show. He throws some food in the slow cooker and sets a timer on his handset for when he needs to check it. With dinner on the way, he sits on his sofa and slips on his glasses. His flock of apps appears around him, including the timer for the food. He pulls forward the show app and pokes the play control on the latest episode thumbnail. He lowers the glasses' light shield so that he can only see the app. His flock fades away and the episode appears around him. Frank leans back and watches events unfold, occasionally tutting to change position or direction in the scene.

The timer eventually rings and he pauses the episode, brings up his flock, lifts the light shield, and turns off the ringer. He pulls off the glasses and makes a bowl of food. When he sits at the table, he puts on the glasses and places a camera window over his food so that when he expands and starts the episode he can see to eat.
