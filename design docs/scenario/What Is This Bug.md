Erin sits at the bus stop and sees a little bug with too many legs. She wonders what it is, so she pulls out her mobile and browses over to the Tree of Life site, then clicks on the link to the identification aug. It prompts her to switch into a magic window view, which she accepts, and then she points the mobile's camera at the bug. It spends a few seconds watching the bug and figuring out that it's a millipede. Erin then switches back to flat view and reads about what this species of millipede eats and how it lives.
